  \devops has changed the software industry to enable continuous delivery. While
  many studies have investigated on how to introduce \devops into a software
  product from the organizational perspective, less is known about the technical
  challenges developers and practitioners face when transforming legacy codes
  into DevOps, despite the undisputed importance of this topic. In this paper,
  throughout the context of web applications, we report the results of a study
  case with the adoption of \numberofprojects legacy open-source projects into
  \devops to understand which refactoring techniques and strategies influence
  developers' decisions. We analyze two dependent variables: the technique used
  and how they are applied to the project. After every implementation, there was
  an overview of the process that just occurred and later a written report on
  how the strategies have been applied, their respective order, which strategy
  has been more fruitful, and such. Those reports have been the foundation of
  this study. The main findings of such study are that some strategies are more
  efficient when viewed from the evolution aspect and the sequence these
  techniques are employed matter.
